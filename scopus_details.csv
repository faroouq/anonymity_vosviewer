These sensor nodes helps in monitoring physical or environmental conditions and also pass their data samples to the main location through the network. In wireless sensor networks the central point of failure is a base station which collects data from several intermediate nodes. But problem occurs when these intermediate nodes fail to forward the data to the destination node. Attacker examines the packet traffic and can easily reach the base station to destroy it thereby rendering the entire sensor network inoperative. In this paper the proposed privacy preservation mechanism mainly focuses on minimizing the energy consumption thereby increasing the network life time and hence reduces the communication overhead in the network as a whole. Hence our proposed scheme involves generation of fake packets by the nodes considering remaining energy of each node. © 2014 IEEE.","base station; energy consumption; fake packets; network lifetime; remaining energy; traffic analysis attack; Wireless sensor network","Base stations; Energy utilization; Wireless sensor networks; Communication overheads; Environmental conditions; fake packets; Information sources; Network lifetime; Privacy preservation; Remaining energies; Traffic analysis attacks; Sensor nodes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923270523"

The exposed contextual information can be utilized by the adversary to deliver attack or derive the sensitive information such as location of the sink nodes, source node and monitored objects. In sensor network the base station (BS) acts as a gateway between the sensor nodes and the control unit. By known information of the physical location of the BS the attacker can alter or destroy the BS intern results that cause the failure of the entire sensor network. There is a need for routing algorithm which can effectively camouflage the location of the BS. In this paper a hybrid algorithm that provides location privacy of the BS has been proposed. The results infer that the proposed algorithm is independent of quantity of the traffic and an adversary will have less than 4 % chance of locating the physical location of the BS.

In a hostile environment the network may be subject to adversary attacks. Given the role that the base-station plays, it can be targeted in order to inflict the most damage to the network. Although stealth design and other physical precautionary measures may be pursued to hide the base-station, the fact that the base-station acts as a sink of all data transmission enables an adversary to employ traffic analysis techniques and identify the location of the base-station. This paper presents a novel approach for countering such traffic analysis and boosting the anonymity of the base-station.

A key part of securing the base station from potential compromise is to secure the information about its physical location. This paper proposes a technique called base station location privacy via software-defined networking (SDN) in wireless sensor networks (BSLPSDN). The inspiration comes from the architecture of SDN, where the control plane is separated from the data plane, and where control plane decides the policy for the data plane. BSLPSDN uses three categories of nodes, namely, a main controller to instruct the overall operations, a dedicated node to buffer and forward data, and lastly, a common node to sense and forward the packet. We employ three kinds of nodes to collaborate and achieve stealth for the base station and thus protecting it against the traffic-analysis attacks. Different traits of the WSN including energy status and traffic density can actively be monitored by BSLPSDN, which positively affects the energy goals, expected life of the network, load on common nodes, and the possibility of creating diversion in the wake of an attack on the base station. We incorporated multiple experiments to analyze and evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. We use single controller with multiple sensor nodes and multiple controllers with multiple sensor nodes to show the level of anonymity of BS. Experiments show that providing BS anonymity via multiple controllers is the best method both in terms of energy and privacy. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","base station location privacy; global and local adversary; latency; software-defined networking; wireless sensor network","Base stations; Controllers; Location; Sensor nodes; Base station location; Base station location privacy; Control planes; Data planes; Data-plane; Energy; Global and local adversary; Latency; Location privacy; Software-defined networkings; Software defined networking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168277836"

And many existing security schemes use traditional cryptography theory to protect message content and contextual information. However, we are concerned about location security of nodes. In this paper, we propose an anonymous routing strategy for preserving location privacy (ARPLP), which sets a proxy source node to hide the location of real source node. And the real source node randomly selects several neighbors as receivers until the packets are transmitted to the proxy source. And the proxy source is randomly selected so that the adversary finds it difficult to obtain the location information of the real source node. Meanwhile, our scheme sets a branch area around the sink, which can disturb the adversary by increasing the routing branch. According to the analysis and simulation experiments, our scheme can reduce traffic consumption and communication delay, and improve the security of source node and base station. © 2019 IEEE.","Anonymous routing; Energy efficiency; Location privacy; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Location; Network routing; Wireless sensor networks; Analysis and simulation; Anonymous routing; Communication delays; Contextual information; Cryptography theory; Location information; Location privacy; Security scheme; Sensor nodes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067839082"

Hence, concealing the physical location of the sink may be necessary in certain circumstances. Previous studies addressing this challenging problem assume a weak adversary model. The problem has not been studied in the presence of an eavesdropper who has global knowledge for the entire network. Here, a naive solution is to employ fake sinks so that nodes send their data not only to the real sink but also to other locations. An alternative solution with less overhead could be provided when all nodes including base station equalize the values of their total incoming and outgoing flows as well as their energy expenditure. This way, no information about the sink location is revealed even when all communication within the network is monitored. In this paper, through a Linear Programming (LP) framework we analyze and compare lifetime limits of wireless sensor networks preserving sink location privacy with the aforementioned two approaches. © 2011 IEEE.","energy efficiency; linear programming; location privacy; network lifetime; sink location; Wireless sensor networks","Base stations; Energy efficiency; Linear programming; Optimization; Sensors; Adversary models; Energy expenditure; Global knowledge; location privacy; network lifetime; Physical locations; sink location; Unobservability; Wireless sensor networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951674791"

This is especially true in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) settings. However, as different networks managed by different parties and with different security requirements are integrated, security becomes a primary concern. WSN nodes, in particular, are often deployed ""in the open"", where a potential attacker can gain physical access to the device. As nodes can be deployed in hostile or difficult scenarios, such as military battlefields or disaster recovery settings, it is crucial to avoid escalation from successful attacks on a single node to the whole network, and from there to other connected networks. It is therefore crucial to secure the communication within the WSN, and in particular, maintain context information, such as the network topology and the location and identity of base stations (which collect data gathered by the sensors) private. In this paper, we propose a protocol achieving anonymous routing between different interconnected IoT or WSN networks, based on the Spatial Bloom Filter (SBF) data structure. The protocol enables communications between the nodes through the use of anonymous identifiers, thus hiding the location and identity of the nodes within the network. The proposed routing strategy preserves context privacy, and prevents adversaries from learning the network structure and topology, as routing information is encrypted using a homomorphic encryption scheme, and computed only in the encrypted domain. Preserving context privacy is crucial in preventing adversaries from gaining valuable network information from a successful attacks on a single node of the network, and reduces the potential for attack escalation. © 2017 ACM.","","Cryptography; Data structures; Disaster prevention; Heterogeneous networks; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network routing; Network security; Sensor nodes; Topology; Context information; Homomorphic Encryption Schemes; Internet of thing (IOT); Military battlefields; Network information; Network structures; Routing information; Security requirements; Wireless sensor networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027023319"

The unique role of the BS makes it a natural target for an adversary's attack. Even if a WSN employs conventional security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication, an adversary may apply traffic analysis techniques to locate the BS. This motivates a significant need for improved BS anonymity to protect the identity, role, and location of the BS. Published anonymity-boosting techniques mainly focus on a single layer of the communication protocol stack and assume that changes in the protocol operation will not be detectable. In fact, existing single-layer techniques may not be able to protect the network if the adversary could guess what anonymity measure is being applied by identifying which layer is being exploited. In this paper we propose combining physical-layer and network-layer techniques to boost the network resilience to anonymity attacks. Our cross-layer approach avoids the shortcomings of the individual single-layer schemes and allows a WSN to effectively mask its behavior and simultaneously misdirect the adversary's attention away from the BS's location. We confirm the effectiveness of our cross-layer anti-traffic analysis measure using simulation. © 2015 IEEE.","anonymity; location privacy; wireless sensor networks","Authentication; Location; Military communications; Network layers; anonymity; Cross-layer approach; Location privacy; Network resilience; Protocol operation; Security mechanism; Traffic analysis attacks; Traffic-analysis techniques; Wireless sensor networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959263808"

These malicious actions cause security and privacy threats and hinder the wide deployment of wireless access networks. To address these problems, efficient BS identification mechanisms are necessary. Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) and channel fingerprinting are potential solutions. Unfortunately, existing solutions are limited to be applicable to scenarios where the locations of pseudo BSs are fixed, while the emerging challenges brought by movable pseudo BSs can hardly be addressed by mature wireless security mechanisms. In this letter, we propose a signal echoing protocol (SEP) to reduce the influence on wireless channels and construct the location-invariant RFF. When BS and user equipment (UE) communicate using SEP, UE can accurately estimate the channel to recognize different BSs.

An adversary can easily find the BS since (in a typical WSN) it is the node with the highest traffic. In this paper, we hide the BS using proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controlled fake packet injection and data aggregation. The data aggregation strategy helps combine data from the sensor nodes into a super-packet, thus reducing the actual traffic.

Therefore, compromising the BS is the holy grail of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) hacking. One of the key techniques used in disabling a network is finding the physical location of the BS and destroying it. This can be achieved through traffic volume analysis. Since the sensor nodes usually send a small amount of data, the data can be cascaded into one Super-packet. This will reduce traffic as well as noise in the network. This technique is the underlying concept behind data funneling. However, data funneling can only reduce the traffic but the relative traffic of the BS compared to the other sensor nodes is still ginormous. Therefore, fake packets from the sensor nodes are needed to cloak the BS. In this paper, data funneling and Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) controlled fake packets are used to reduce the number of packets sent to the BS and control fake packets generated by the sensor nodes to hide the BS respectively. The proposed system reduces the traffic of the system by a factor of K, where K is the ratio of 1 to the maximum number of packets that can be fused into one packet. © 2019 IEEE.","","Base stations; Personal computing; Proportional control systems; Sensor nodes; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Physical locations; Proportional integral and derivatives; Traffic volumes; Gateways (computer networks)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081110980"

Such information can then used by the adversary for the attack. The existing privacy techniques defend against a local adversary. There are two main categories of privacy preservation in Wireless Sensor Networks. They are data privacy and the context privacy. In this paper, we describe Location privacy. Location privacy is extremely important in Wireless Sensor Networks. Information on location of events or on location of base stations can be of a primary concern of adversary. Location privacy is very important in hostile environments. It is sufficient for the adversary to find out location of sensors currently monitoring the location of the source to successfully localize and capture the source. Similarly, the adversary only needs to find out location of the base station to be able to mount a physical or other DoS attack on the base station and thus inactivate the whole network. In this paper, they are two main categories of privacy preserving techniques for Wireless sensor network that have been presented, data-oriented and context-oriented. So different techniques against a universal adversary with respect to context privacy are discussed. The paper presents recurrent clustering mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.","Clustering; Eavesdropper; location privacy; Privacy; Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations; Communication; Embedded systems; Wireless sensor networks; Clustering; Clustering mechanism; Context privacy; Eavesdropper; Hostile environments; Location privacy; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879873089"

Security is a major concern in military forces and border surveillance. BS which collects information from sensors has become the main target of attack for intruders. Anonymous intruder eavesdrops into network, analyzes the radio patterns to get contextual information, and can find where the BS location is. Attacker can destroy BS or alter its behavior which results in malfunctioning or complete failure of the entire network. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm for the BS anonymity has been proposed which provides protection for the sink node against adversaries. By making the BS anonymous in the network, it will be difficult for any intruder to find the location of the BS. The proposed algorithm is developed and simulated in MATLAB. The results infer that the anonymity of BS is independent of traffic volume and the algorithm proposed is efficient with varying locations of the sensor nodes. The anonymity value of BS for each topology is below 0.04. This infers that for the topology simulated an intruder conducting the traffic pattern analysis of WSN considered have a less than 4% probability of detecting the BS on the first trail when searching for physical location for the BS. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Base station; Contextual information; Location privacy; Security measures; Wireless sensor networks","Base stations; Location; Topology; Wireless sensor networks; Border surveillance; Contextual information; Hybrid algorithms; Location privacy; Physical locations; Security measure; Traffic pattern; Traffic volumes; Sensor nodes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065505582"

In a hostile application environment the network may be attacked. Since the base-station plays a critical role and acts as a sink for all data traffic, it may be subject of pointed attack from an adversary that opts to inflict the most impact on the network. Despite of all physical precautionary measures for hiding the base-station, traffic analysis techniques can uncover its location since it is the end point of all data routes. This paper presents a novel distributed algorithm that boosts the anonymity of the base-station. A local sniffer adversary model is assumed where the source of a transmission is determined and used to search for the next hop until reaching the base-station. To counter such an attack, sensors in the vicinity of the adversary will transmit deceptive packets in order to divert the sniffer away from the base-station. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the approach. © 2011 IEEE.","Anonymity; Deceptive Packets; In-situ Adversary; Location Privacy; Wireless Sensor Networks","Communication; Sensors; Anonymity; Deceptive Packets; In-situ; Location Privacy; Wireless sensor; Wireless sensor networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857205658"
